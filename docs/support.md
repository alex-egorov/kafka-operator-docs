## Support

The Kafka operator is a core part of [Banzai Cloud Supertubes](/products/supertubes/) that helps you create production-ready Kafka cluster on Kubernetes, with scaling, rebalancing, and alerts based self healing. While the Kafka operator itself is an [open-source project](https://github.com/banzaicloud/kafka-operator/), the [Banzai Cloud Supertubes](https://banzaicloud.com/products/one-eye/) product extends the functionality of the Kafka operator with commercial features (for example, built-in monitoring and multiple ways of disaster recovery).

### Community support

If you encounter problems while using the Logging operator the documentation does not address, [open an issue](https://github.com/banzaicloud/kafka-operator/issues) or talk to us on the Banzai Cloud Slack channel [#kafka-operator](https://pages.banzaicloud.com/invite-slack).

### Commercial support

If you are using the Kafka operator in a production environment and [require commercial support, contact Banzai Cloud](https://banzaicloud.com/contact/), the company backing the development of the Kafka operator.
